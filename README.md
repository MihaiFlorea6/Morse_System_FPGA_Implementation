This project represents an implementation concept of a real-time Morse Code transmitter and display system on the Basys 3 FPGA board using Verilog. 
It encodes alphanumeric characters into Morse code and visualizes them through LED blinking patterns. 

-> The design integrates key digital system principles such as real-time signal handling, clock division for timing control, and edge detection for user input via buttons.
-> A finite state machine (FSM) governs the encoding and LED output logic, illustrating the application of synchronous design, debouncing, and modular hardware description techniques within an FPGA-based environment.
